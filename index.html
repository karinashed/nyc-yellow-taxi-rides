        NYC TAXI RIDERS ARE STILL DECENT TIPPERS

        Despite a global pandemic and crippling inflation, passengers of NYC's yellow cabs have been tipping drivers at a pretty constant rate.

          It's no secret that New York City's yellow taxi industry has been struggling over the past few years (thanks, Uber!). And with a global pandemic 
          and rising inflation, the New Yorkers and tourists that ride the cabs haven't been having the easiest time either.
          But, despite the challenges, an analysis of <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page">trip record data</a> between
          January 2019 to April 2023, made public by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), shows that yellow cab riders have continued to 
          tip at a pretty steady rate.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you consider a 10 to 20 percent tip to be the gold standard, then you might be surprised to learn that — when passengers paid for their ride 
          with a credit card — the average tip has been hovering around 26 percent of the total fare since the start of 2019. 
          We, sadly, don't know how riders tip when paying with cash.
        </p>

        <p>
          While the average tip percent <i> is </i> currently trending downward, the most recently available average from April of this year
          is fewer than two percentage points lower than the highest average tip since the start of 2019.   
        </p>

        <p>
          While the tipping data is only reflective of payments made using <b>credit card</b>, another analysis of the ride data shows that passengers 
          are overwhelmingly using card, not cash, to pay for their rides. 
        </p>

        <iframe title="Credit Card is King" aria-label="Multiple Pies" id="datawrapper-chart-TU6MV" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TU6MV/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="252" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>

        <p>
          It's all good and well that passengers are still tipping their drivers, but people are simply not taking taxis as much as they used to. 
          Once COVID-19 hit NYC, taxi ridership dipped dramatically. Yellow taxis took fewer than 250,000 trips in April 2020, which is down from 
          more than 6 million trips in February of the same year.
          Ridership <i>has</i> increased from that slump over the past few years, but not nearly to where it used to be. 
          Ridership hasn't surpassed 4 million rides per month since the pandemic started.

        <p>While this analysis paints a picture of what's been going on in the world of yellow taxis, it doesn't quite illustrate how it fits into the 
          wider context of transportation in NYC. Are passengers forgoing yellow cabs for ride-share apps like Uber and Lyft? 
          Are tipping patterns on these apps similar? Seems like another analysis with lots more data is in order to find out. </p>
